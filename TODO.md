Things I can possibly do

* Hide / commands in chat
* UUID location from clientcontext files
* Persist state to local JSON files to handle restarts
* Captain's Log
* User notes
* Chat colors?  Either hide them or use them
* Decompose server.coffee
    * Tests for server state maintenance
    * Tests for REST endpoints
* Paging for chat log API (server/chat).  Gets REAL big otherwise
* Relay chat to IRC
* upstart / init.d scripts
* modPath, display mods running on the server using standard format

Things when tech exists

* Send chat into the game from web / hipchat / IRC
